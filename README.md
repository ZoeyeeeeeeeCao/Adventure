# Adventure

This is the repository for Adventure Final



1. Before you start, press "New branch". You can name it whatever you want, choose based on main. Then you need publish your branch so that everyone can see it.



Make sure the current branch is the branch you make, so that all of the change will be record at your branch.



Then open unity, in the scene folder, create a new scene with your name. Then save it in unity, after that open github desktop. You will see the changes you make. In the update part, write a title and description ( whatever you want, this is for record the history version if you wanna reverse back later on), then press **Push** on the top right corner, so the Update will be pushed.



Then Switch the current branch into main branch, choose " Choose a branch to merge with main " , select your branch to update this main branch, remember to press push. 



If you are not the last person, for example, you are 3rd, at the time you finsh that, the main will only have 3 scenes in the scene folder. So after every create their own scence, you need to set the current branch to your branch, and choose " Choose a branch to merge with <YourBranchName> " to merge your branch with the main branch to get the lastest Update. Then push to update your branch.



2\. **All of the Assets must be put in to the folder "OnlineAssets"** 

You won't see it when you open unity, you need to create it yourself, the **spelling must be complete the same**, because I set Unity to Ignore this folder, so the spelling must be the same for github to recognized this.

Once you finsh that, you need to check in GItHub. Make sure github **didn't** record something like **AdventureGame/Assets/OnlineAssets.meta** (If you don't have this change, means that you success).

So once this folder is successfuly made, you can impart packages, then drag all the packages into this OnlineAssets folder, so that the assets won't be upload to GitHub ( Because the size is so big so it is better to save it at local disk)
